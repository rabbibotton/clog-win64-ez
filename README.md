*** Easy CLOG Builder Install for Windows 64 ***

This version is based on sbcl 2.4.3

*** setup.bat ***

- Unzip where you would like your install to reside and run setup.bat

This is used for a fresh brand new install. (To recreate a new install you can
also delete the quicklisp directory and then run package.bat. If you stored
any projects in the quicklisp local projects you will want to save or move to
the common-lisp directory at the root of the Easy install version.)

This will install the latest code from QuickLisp and UltraLisp. If you want a
custom version of any packages place them in common-lisp/

builder.exe will be created, can run it from the command line, double clicking
or drag to your application bar.


*** make.bat and update.bat ***

- To update to the latest version of CLOG Builder run update.bat 
  (Do frequently, as I add new features constantly)

- If you change the director of this install run make.bat
